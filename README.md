## Notes on Bugs:
the game may crash more than a couple of times at complete random times.
this was a result of the engine crashing mid creation of the game causing several files to be corrupted:
it got corrupted just enough to be playable, but only sometimes
for example:
the skeleton can crash the game when firing in one playthrough
and then in the second playthrough the game would run with no issues
